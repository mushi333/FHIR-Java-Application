# FHIR-Java-Application
## Description
This is an old application from my FIT3077 - Software Engineering: Architecture and Design unit. In this unit we were tasked with creating an application that can interact with the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources(FHIR) API and retrieve patient/doctors information in a clean and engineered manner.

## Main Requirments
* Java 8
* Maven v4.0.0
* FHIR API v4.1.0
* jfreechart v1.5.0
* Logback Classic v1.1.7

## How to Run
1. Using Maven, install the necessary dependencies in the included pom file.
2. Compile the program.
3. Run the main method in Application.java file.

## Future
For future works, this application can be converted to a Nest.js backend application that serves static web pages.
